This project develops an advanced feedback control system that dynamically adjusts voltage and frequency outputs in real-time, compensating for temperature-induced fluctuations. The system utilizes a microprocessor-controlled feedback loop to maintain stable output parameters, ensuring optimal performance and reliability in temperature-sensitive hardware applications.
